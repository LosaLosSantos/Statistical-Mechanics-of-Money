# Statistical-Mechanics-of-Money

This project explores the application of statistical mechanics to economic systems, particularly focusing on the equilibrium distribution of money among agents in a closed economic system. The project is inspired by the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution in physics and extends it to economic modeling.

## Overview

In a closed economic system, money is conserved, similar to energy in a physical system. By simulating money exchange among agents, the equilibrium probability distribution of money is shown to follow the Boltzmann-Gibbs law. The project also investigates the effects of introducing debt, taxation, and subsidies into the system.

## Features

- **Simulations Without Debt**: Models money exchange among agents while conserving total money.
- **Simulations With Debt**: Explores the impact of allowing agents to incur limited debt.
- **Simulations With Taxes and Subsidies**: Incorporates taxation and redistribution to study the resulting money distribution.
- **Entropy Evolution**: Analyzes the entropy of the system over time for different transaction mechanisms.
- **Comparison to Theoretical Models**: Compares simulation results with theoretical predictions from statistical mechanics.

## Key Components

- **Boltzmann-Gibbs Distribution**: Demonstrates the emergence of the exponential distribution of money in equilibrium.
- **Debt Dynamics**: Studies how allowing agents to incur debt broadens the distribution and increases inequality.
- **Taxation and Subsidies**: Examines the effect of taxation on the system's temperature and money distribution.
